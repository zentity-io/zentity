# zentity

zentity is an **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)** plugin for entity resolution.

zentity aims to be:

- **Simple** - Entity resolution is hard. zentity makes it easy.
- **Fast** - Get results in real-time. From milliseconds to low seconds.
- **Generic** - Resolve anything. People, companies, locations, sessions, and more.
- **Transitive** - Resolve over multiple hops. Recursion finds dynamic identities.
- **Multi-source** - Resolve over multiple indices with disparate mappings.
- **Accommodating** - Operate on data as it exists. No changing or reindexing data.
- **Logical** - Logic is easier to read, troubleshoot, and optimize than statistics.
- **100% Elasticsearch** - Elasticsearch is a great foundation for entity resolution.
